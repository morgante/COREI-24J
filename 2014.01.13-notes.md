# Statistics
## Fair coin
15 out of 17 times heads

Experiment 10,000 times:
- Flip a fair coin 17 times
- Count heads

p = (number of times heads ≥ 15)/10,000
null hypothesis = coin is fair

## Drug trial
Drug is +13 more effective than placebo on average

10,000 times:
- Shuffle the treatments randomly amongst the patients
- Average effectiveness of drug in this permutation?

p = (number of times effectiveness ≥ 13)/10,000
null hypothesis = effectiveness is 0

## Medical Test
P(T, D) = 0.9
P(~T, D) = 0.1
P(~T, ~D) = 0.9
P(T, ~D) = 0.1
P(D) = 0.01

Out of 1000 people, 10 will have the disease.
When tested, 9 of them will test positive.
Of the other 990 people, 99 will test positive.
So, P(T, D) = 8.3%
