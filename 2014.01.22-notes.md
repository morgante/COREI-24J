# Secret Sharing
3 courriers. Any 1 can be captured and the Romans learn nothing. Any 2 have complete information.

Encode the location into a number. Find the line which intersects the y-axis at that number.
Give a point on that line to each courier. One point tells you nothing, while 2 points are determinate of the y-axis.

You can also make it require 3 courriers by giving 3 points along parabola and use vertex as location.

# Fallacies of Multiple Test
If you try experiments thousands of times, you'll still see statistical significance in some small percentage of cases.
For example, if you do 20,000 experiments you might expect 200 of them to have a p-value of 0.01.

# Information Gain
To build the decision tree:
# Compute all information gains
# First level is question with most information gain
# For each subtree, computer information gains
# For top level of subtree use most (new) information gain
# Repeat for all subtrees

Calculate information gain:

	IG(A|B) = I(A) - I(A|B)
	I(A) = P(A)*log(1/P(A))/log(2) + P(~A)*log(1/P(~A))/log(2)
	I(A|B) = P(B)*I(A|B) + P(~B)*I(A|B)
