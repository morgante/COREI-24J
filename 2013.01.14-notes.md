# Statistics is easy
- [ ] Read introduction to statistics is easy
- [ ] Review what a confidence interval is, etc.

# Erathosthene
First "measured" size of Earth

Fairly accurate (approximately equivilant to modern measurements)

## Assumptions
- Cosmos follows normal laws and is a set of objects in space.
- Earth is round.
- The sun's rays are parallel as they hit Earth.

# Galileo
Feather & hammer fall at same speed
Undermined Aristotlean motion

Investigated motion at University of Pisa
Built his telescope in Padua
Published book about his beliefs

Catholic Church force him to recant

Questionable whether he ever did the experiment on the Leaning Tower of Pisa
That story comes from his biographer (Vincenzio)

## Aristotlean motion
Different lies apply on Earth and heavens
Earth revolves around sun

# Newton
Traditional view of light: prisms change light

Red + blue impossible sequence of light liquids

Rainbow: raindrops act as tiny prisms

# Foucault
People knew Earth rotated

Carioles effect:
- Water rotates differently in different hemispheres

Swing = 360*sin(latitude)
Ex. Abu Dhabi: 149ยบ/day = 360*sin(24.4667ยบ)

# Milikin
- Physics textbook author
- Assistant, University of Chicago's Ryerson Laboratory

Strength of an electron's charge?

- 1897: J.J Thompson discovers electrons and their negative chart
- Thompson & Harold Wilson (student) attempt water vapor experiments with horizontal metal plates
- Millikan reverses the electrical current to counteract gravity and looks at specific droplets

Millikan published only 58 of his 140 drops, though the missing drops had experimental error.
Worried by critism of earlier research, and even including the results wouldn't change his conclusions.
