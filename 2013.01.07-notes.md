Because next week is a shorter than expected week, the presentations on Crease from days two and three will be combined on day two (Tuesday, Jan 14).

- [x] Please try to determine two games that you wish to be challengers for in the sovereign of the hill competition. [due jan 8]
	Dating Game & Sudokill
- [x] Pick a chapter of natural computing [due jan 8]
		please try to determine which chapter of 
		Natural Computing you'd like to present about from these (in every
		case a whole chapter, even if only one name is presented and two
		are featured):
		Rodney Brooks; Gleenn Reeves; Louis Qualls; Jake Loveless; Nancy Leveson; D.E. Shaw.

		**David Shaw**

- [x] By tomorrow (Wed, Jan 8):
Please be prepared to discuss some experimental idea.
It would be awesome for you to start conducting the experiment this weekend.
**Morgante: experiment will be to allow a person to choose some article in a field they know and to run the software and for them to determine whether the acronyms were correctly translated.** That shoud be filmed.
Juan Felipe: take people through your software to set up a diet and try to follow for a few days next week.

# Monty Hall Problem
10 doors, 1 with a treasure — switching wins 9/10 times

1. Write down equally probable states of the initial world
2. When you get new information, cross out impossible states

(9/10)*(1/8)=9/80=0.1125 ≥ 0.1

Generalized, for *n* doors and host opens *k* doors:
((n-1)/n)*(k/(n-2)) vs. 1/n

# Russian Roulette
6 chambers, 2 bullets next to each other:

## Scenarios:
	BB----
	-BB---
	--BB--
	---BB-
	----BB
	B----B

## Strategy:
0. ``
	- don't spin (1/3 die) = 2/6
	- do spin (1/3 die)
1. `-`
	- don't spin (1/4 die) = (2-1)/(6-2)
	- do spin (1/3)
2. `--`
	- don't spin (1/3 die) = (2-1)/(6-3)
	- do spin (1/3)
3. `---`
	- don't spin (1/2 die)
	- do spin (1/3 die)

## n=8; k=3
	BBB-----
	-BBB----
	--BBB---
	---BBB--
	----BBB-
	-----BBB
	B-----BB
	BB-----B

0. 3/8
1. (3-2)/(8-3)
2. (3-2)/(8-4)
3. (3-2)/(8-5)

## Equation
Given *n* chambers, *k* bullets next to each other
0. ``
	- don't spin (k/n die)
	- do spin (k/n die)
c. `-`
	- don't spin: 1/(n-(k+(c-1)))
	- do spin (k/n)

Spin until chamber *c*, where:
	1/(n-k-c+1)=(k/n)
