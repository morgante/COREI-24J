# Bait & Switch
many envelopes, checks stacked in random order
- one has 2 checks ($200, $400)
- one has 2 checks ($400, $800)
- one has 2 checks ($800, $1600)
- one has 2 checks ($1600, $3200)
- one has 2 checks ($3200, $6400)

pick an envelope and look at first check, 2 options:
— switch checks within envelope
— take the check you picked

## Strategy
- if we picked $200, always switch
- if we picked $6400, never switch
- if we picked anything else, always switch

## Expected values of switching
| first	| EV 	| formula				|
|-------|-------|-----------------------|
| $200 	| $400 	|  						|
| $400 	| $500 	| 0.5(200)+0.5(800) 	|
| $800 	| $1000	| 0.5(400)+0.5(1600) 	|
| $1600 | $2000 | 0.5(800)+0.5(3200) 	|
| $3200 | $4000 | 0.5(1600)+0.5(6400) 	|
| $6400 | $3200 | 						|

	EVs(d)=(1/2)(d/2)+(1/2)(2d)=d/4+d=d(5/4)

# Feedback
A system can correct itself by comparing desired output with actual output and adjusting.

## Formalism
- no feedback: 
	O= A(I)
- feedback:
	O= A(I-F(O))
	O= AI-AFO
	1= AI/O-AF
	AF~AI/O (drop the 1)
	O~AI/AF
	O~I/F

- [ ] read/solve feedback dividends puzzle (from Puzzle book, p49) [due tomorrow]
