## Spy vs. spy
Proposed by McCarthy in 1958

Guards might be shooting down spies on way back from foreign country. Guards are unreliable and won't recognize the spy.

So you need a password mechanism. The border guards go to the local bars and chat, so can't be trusted. Spies can be trusted.

Hint: use Van Neumann. x=341 -> 341*341=116281 -> 162 = y

Give y to guard and x to spy. (Irreversible hash function.)

Complexity: feasibility vs. infeasibility

## Rabin's Style
- Find simple to understand problems that others consider too difficult to solve.
- Find an algorithm that's hard to discover but simple/efficient to implement.

# Movie Stars Experiment
- Quized on 12 names, 7 of whom were real movie stars
