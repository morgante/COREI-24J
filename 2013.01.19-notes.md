# Rodney Brooks
- Deployed virtual memory while still in Australia
- CSAIL professor
- CTO of Rething Robotics

"Elephants don't play chess" so we human intelligence isn't necessary to survival.

Robots:
# Simplistic Allen robot was his first.
# Six-legged walking robot emphasized strength-to-weight ratio.

Worked with Strategic Defense Initiative and sent a robot to the moon. Also designed Roomba robots.

Rethink Robotics made a robotic arm to safely work with humans

# Glen Reeves
Pomona University

Developed software for Cassini 1991 mission to Saturn. Also developed software for 1997 Mars Pathfinder.
And Mars Exploration Rover in 2000.

Challenges: prepare for the unexpected (landing, dust, temperature, radiation, communication)

# Adrian Stoica
Of Romanian origin.
Made self-evolving chip which adapts to temperatures between -180ยบ and 120ยบC
Interested in terraforming other planets

# Game/simulation
Many agents, each with power

An agent or a coalition of agents (P1) can challenge any other agent or coalition (P2).
P2 can try to get allies. P1 can disengage. P1 destroys P2 if P1 > P2 and vice versa.
P1 acquires wealth of P2, but no effect on power.

## Unstable Situation
A conquers all unilaterally:
- A: 5
- B: 3
- C: 1

## New scenario
Stable (no unilateral destruction)
- A: 5
- B: 4
- C: 3

## Very unstable
- A: 5
- B: 5
- C: 5

## New one
- A: 5
- B: 5
- C: 5
- D: 5

Depends on risk tolerance of agents. Needs 3 risk-tolerant agents to become unstable

## Scenario More
- A: 7
- B: 6
- C: 5
- D: 4

Maybe B/C/D attack A. If A attacks anyone unilaterally, others step in. If A attacks anyone else with 1 partner, they win.

A: team with C to kill B=3. (nobody stops) team with B to kill C.
B: team with C to kill A=3.5. (D stops) team with A to kill C.
C: team with B to kill A=3.5. (D stops) team with A to kill B=3
D: team with B/C to kill A=3.5. (B or C stop)

## Extensions
Neutrality? Nuclear weapons? Strategic bullying?
